\section{User Study}
We conducted a user study to examine the effectiveness of our system to construct the corresponding 3D model of the planar layout, and the guiding effectiveness of users fabricating the practical mockup. In the experiment, participants were asked to construct the 3D model of the 2D layout they randomly chose after a brief introduction of our system, and rate our system on two points: the complexity of operation and the usability of layout optimization. After that, participants were separated equally into two groups, one group was asked to fold the given practical printed paper into 3D mockup with the guide video provided by our system and the fabrication time was recorded compared with another group without the guide video. Our goal was to test the following hypotheses:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Hypo1:} Our system need less time and effort to construct a digital 3D mockup than traditional software.
	\item \textbf{Hypo2:} Our system can provide novel and practical function to reach diverse layouts.
	\item \textbf{Hypo3:} Our system can guide the fabrication of cartons.
\end{itemize}
