	abstract = "The recovery of three-dimensional configurations of a scence from its image is one of the most important steps in computer vision. The Origami world is a model for understanding line drawings in terms of surfaces, and for finding their 3-D configurations. It assumes that surfaces themselves can be stand-alone objects, unlike the conventional trihedral world which assumes solid objects. we have established a labeling procedure for this Origami world, which can find the 3-D meaning of a given line drawing by assigning one of the labels, + (convex edge), – (concave edge), ←, and → (occluding boundary) to each line. The procedure uses a filtering procedure not only for junction labels as in the Waltz labeling for the trihedral world, but also for checking the consistency of surface orientations. The theory includes the Huffman-Clowes labelings for the trihedral solid-object world as a subset. This paper also reveals interesting relationships among previous research in polyhedral scene analysis."

	Develop comprehensive kinematic synthesis for rigid origami of thick panels which have the identical motion to that of zero-thickness origami. The authors provide the models for 4, 5, 6 crease lines single vertex. Multi-vertex without rotation symmetry is not discussed.
