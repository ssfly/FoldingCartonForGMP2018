\begin{abstract}
Cartons are broadly used in the packaging industry and in our daily life. While most traditional packages are axis-aligned cuboids, there is a recent trend of creating paper packages and cartons with more complicated geometries. In this work, we present an interactive system to manipulate 3D cartons from 2D layouts. Two key components, \emph{automatic folding} and \emph{suggestive editing}, make our system remarkably easy to use. 
The automatic folding step computes the 3D coordinates of vertexes in a 3D carton model based on a simple observation. Then, the suggestive editing step determines several geometric constraints, such as vertex merging, merging propagation, and panel pasting, so that user can flexibly manipulate 3D shapes.
Moreover, our system supports automatic updating of the corresponding 2D layouts when the user constructs and edits carton shapes in 3D to correct and explore potential layouts.

\section{Conclusion and Future Work}\label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper, we present an interactive modeling system to construct a 3D carton model from a 2D expanded layout. 
Based on the automatically folded rough model, a series of shape refinement suggestions are provided for smartly optimizing and editing the carton model, which assists users to produce the desired model efficiently and productively. 
%
Our current system could be further improved in many directions. 
More intelligent editing tools can be implemented. For example, when the user moves a vertex, the translation could be propagated to other symmetric vertexes.
We also would like to improve our automatic folding part with a more comprehensive optimization formulation considering both shape closure and stability. 
%
Moreover, it is desired by designers to support appearance editing in our system.
