\begin{abstract}
Cartons are broadly used in packaging industry and our daily life. While most of traditional packages are axis-aligned cuboids, there is a recent trend of creating paper packages and cartons with more complicated geometry. In this work, we present an interactive system to manipulate 3D cartons from 2D layouts. Two key components, \emph{automatic folding} and \emph{suggestive editing}, make our system significantly easy to use. 
The automatic folding part automatically computes the 3D coordinates of vertexes in cartons based on simple observation. Then the suggestive editing part smartly provides a group of geometric constraints, such as vertex merging, merging propagation, and face pasting, for users to explore and manipulate 3D shapes.
Moreover, automatic updating of 2D layout is supported when the user edits the carton shape in 3D.

\section{Conclusion and Future Work}\label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper, we present an interactive modeling system to construct a 3D carton model from a 2D expanded layout. 
Based on the automatically folded rough model, a series of shape refinement suggestions are provided for smartly optimizing and editing the carton model, which assists users on producing the desired model efficiently and productively. 
%
Our current system could be further improved in many directions. 
More intelligent editing tools can be implemented. For example, when the user moves a vertex, the vertex translation can be propagated to other symmetric vertexes.
We also would like to improve our automatic folding part with a more comprehensive optimization formulation considering both shape closure and stability. 
%
Moreover, it is desired by designers to support appearance editing in our system.
