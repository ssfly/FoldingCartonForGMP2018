\section{Results and Discussion}\label{sec:result}


Based on the two-step approach of folding a carton model as well as the suggestive user interface, our system is natural and easy to use. 
%
We will show a series of results of cartons in various shapes. 
%
\reply{A user study was also conducted to examine the effectivenss of our suggestive system.}

\subsection{Carton Results}

%%%%%%%%%%% Fully automatic results %%%%%%%%%%%

For most cuboid cartons, their 3D models can be generated by folding each edge by $\pi/2$, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:initial-automatic} and Figure~\ref{fig:automatic-more}.
In the common design process nowadays, designers typically spend much time on manually creating the 3D carton models in 3D modeling softwares. 
Our suggestive interface significantly saves the designers' effort so that they can focus on the appearance designing of cartons.

	\caption{More carton examples that can be automatically generated. \xjmd{For each example, four subfigures are shown from left to right: the input 2D layout, an intermediate stage during folding, and the final 3D shape at two different views.}  }
	\label{fig:automatic-more}
	
\end{figure}

%%%%%%%%%% Results with refinement %%%%%%%%%%

For more complicated cartons, shape refinement is required. 
An entire process of creating a carton model from a 2D layout is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:result}.
%
The final model can be generated by three clicks from the user to confirm vertex merging two times, and \cxj{face pasting} in one time.
\reply{Note that our system automatically detects these possible geometric editing options for users to select. Therefore, the user can get rid of the tedious work of selecting edges or vertexes and assigning precise length or positions to them.}
%
A more challenging example is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:hexagon}. 
By initially folding each edge as $\pi/2$, our system firstly generates a cube inside the carton for the six square faces. 
Sometimes, our system fails to detect mergeable vertexes with a small threshold $\epsilon$ to merge closeby vertexes.
%
However, the user could manually select two vertexes to merge. Then our systems automatically detects two symmetric vertexes that also can be merged. 
%
Finally, a hexagonal carton can be generated in a limited number of user interactions.

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/105}
	\caption{Structural layout is used to generate flat polymesh, and then initialize to a rough model, after two vertex merging confirmations and one face pasting confirmation, we can finally have its corresponding 3D model.}

	\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{images/limitation}
	\caption{Given a layout as (a), our system can generate an initialized result as (b), and through almost ten steps including selecting merging vertexes and faces need to be coplane , users can reach the final model as (d). }
	\label{fig:hexagon}
\end{figure}


\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{images/newMore}
	\caption{More results need refinement. Users can manipulate more complicated cartons. The first and second column in each sub-figure are the flat mesh and initialization result of cartons, and the last two column shows the model after interaction in  different views. Circles marked in red means the part that need to be merged.}
	\label{fig:result-more}
\end{figure}



More carton models generated using our system \xjmd{with a few user interactions} are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:result-more}.
The statistics of the face number, edge number, and number of user interactions are listed in Table~\ref{table:statistics}. 
We can see that only a few user interactions on confirming system suggestions are needed for a variety of shapes.

\paragraph{Limitations}

%%%%%%%%%% Limitations and discussions %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\reply{
	Shape optimization can be used in most cases through interaction, however, there are still some failure cases that we can not deal with. Figure~\ref{fig:failure} shows a case that failed to generate 3D model by optimization. The faces circled in red should be merged together to produce a strong enforced face, while our system expanded the face away. Moreover, we cannot deal with the case that if we want to layout down the back red face and keep the bottom lines of green side faces together. The carton layouts whose face graph has a loop will also be failed to construct corresponding model such as milk cartons.
