\section{Results and Discussion}\label{sec:result}
{\color{red}{show every step of results and analysis, show Figure~\ref{fig:result}, limitation, more results Figure~\ref{fig:more}}}

The step of shape optimization in our paper can be best demonstrated on the model~\ref{fig:result}, through initialization, we can have a rough concept of the final model, and by user interaction, we can finally generate a pleasing model from a given structural layout.

We show a number of 3D models generated by our system~\ref{fig:more}, and most of the cases can have an ideal result after initialization because of the common shape. However, the initialization will not generate a pleasing result on some complicated cases Figure~\ref{fig:limitation}, and leads to the difficult interaction to get the final model.
