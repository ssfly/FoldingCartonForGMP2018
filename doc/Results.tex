{\color{red}{SS: Any need to list the number of steps we take to generate final model?}}

The step of shape optimization in our paper can be best demonstrated on the model~\ref{fig:result}, through initialization, we can have a rough concept of the final model, and by user interaction including selecting vertices merged and faces in the same plane, we can finally generate a pleasing model from a given structural layout.

We show a number of 3D models generated by our system Figure~\ref{fig:more}, and most of the cases can have an ideal result after initialization because of the cuboid shape as Figure~\ref{fig:more} (a). Through interaction, users can folding more complicated cartons to ideal shapes as Figure~\ref{fig:more} (b).

However, the initialization will not generate a pleasing result on some complicated cases, and leads to the difficult interaction to get the final model. As for Figure~\ref{fig:limitation}, to have a better corresponding model, users need to take at least ten steps to get to Figure~\ref{fig:limitation}(c).

The first and second column in (a) and (b) are the flat mesh and initialization result of cartons, and the last column in (b) shows the model after interaction.}
