\section{Algorithm}\label{sec:optimization}

\comments{
Assuming every face in the carton model is rigid, which means the interior angle in each plane stays the same.  
%
Furthermore, planes are connected by hinges at the boundary of patches, and the planar layout has its front and back.}

In this section, we explain our algorithm in detail. 
Initially, assume that the 2D layout $\mathcal{L}$ lies on the $XOY$ plane, so that each vertex $\mathbf{v}_i(x_i,y_i,z_i)$ in $V$ has $z_i=0$. 
Each face in $F$ has a normal $\mathbf{n}_i=(0,0,1)^T$.
%
In the first step of our algorithm, our system automatically {\color{blue}{folds the original flat mesh into a rough model by assigning a specific angle to each folding edge.}}
%computes the normal of the desired 3D carton based simple rules of orthogonality and parallelism.
In the second step, the carton shape is refined based on a set of potential geometric constraints.

\subsection{Shape Refinement}\label{sec:refinement}

%there is still a need to refine the results that have not folded into pleasing results. 
Though not perfect, the initial 3D shape provides a good start point for generating the final carton model. 
%
To further refine the 3D shape, the 3D coordinates of all the vertexes are then refined based on a set of shape constraints, such as vertex merging, face pasting, and so on.
%
%the main idea is to prescribe the shape constrains by a set of vertexes of the polymesh. 
%Moreover, with the extra information acquired from user interaction, we can finally construct the desired 3D realization.
In this step, the coordinate of vertexes are chosen as our objective instead of angles on folding edges, mainly because that the geometric constrains in 3D shapes can be more simply and intuitively represented by 3D vertexes.
% and we can implement the algorithm introduced by Bouaziz et al. easily~\cite{Bouaziz:2012:SSD:2346796.2346802}.
 

%\subsection{Aided Detection}

%While the initial 3D model with simple angle folding provides a rough idea about the carton shape, 
A suggestive interface is provided to users for efficiently explore better carton shapes, as described later in Sec.~\ref{sec:interaction}. 
%
Once the user selects a suggested shape refinement operation, we optimize the 3D shape based on a series of geometric constraints.
%We now introduce the constrains used in our construction method:
Given the current mesh whose vertex positions are defined as $\{\vo_i\}^{N}_{i=1}$, a new mesh with the same topology but new vertex positions $\{\vn_i\}^{N}_{i=1}$ is constructed.
%
The geometric constraints can be classified into two groups, \cxj{shape rigidity constraints and shape modification constraints}.
% 
First, to keep the rigidity of each face, the constraints including edge length constraint, coplanarity, and face rigidity, which are corresponding to similarity constraint and plane constraint described in \cite{Bouaziz:2012:SSD:2346796.2346802}. 
%
Second, once two vertexes or two faces are confirmed to be merged to modify the rough shape, more constraints are added. 
%
Each constraint is defined as following.  

\paragraph{Edge length constraint.} 
For each edge in $\{e_j\}_{j=1...M}$, its length should be preserved when refine the carton shape.
Hence, its two endpoints $\mathbf{v}_{js}$ and end point $\mathbf{v}_{jt}$ should satisfy 
\begin{equation}
||\mathbf{v}_{js} - \mathbf{v}_{jt}||^2 = ||\mathbf{\hat{v}}_{js} - \mathbf{\hat{v}}_{jt}||^2.
\label{equ:edge}
\end{equation}
%to ensure that the length of each edge stays the same.

\paragraph{Coplanarity} {For each face $\{f_k\}_{k=1,\dots,P}$, the coplanarity constraint specifies all vertexes in a face should always lie on a plane. 
We can compute the sorted eigenvectors $\mathbf{U} = [\mathbf{e}_1, \mathbf{e}_2, \mathbf{e}_3]$ of the $ 3 \times 3$ covariance matrix $\mathbf{C}^T\mathbf{C}$ where $\mathbf{C} = \{\mathbf{v}_{kj}\}_{j=1}^{N_k}$, $\mathbf{v}_{kj}$ is the $j$th vertex among $N_k$ vertexes in face $p_k$}. Plane projection can be obtained by removing the last column of $\mathbf{U}$. 


\paragraph{Face rigidity} For each face $\{p_k\}_{k=1 \dots P}$, the length of each line connecting two non-adjacent points $\mathbf{v}_{ka}, \mathbf{v}_{kb}$ on the plane remains the same, so that the shape of each plane keeps unchanged.
\begin{equation}
||\mathbf{v}_{ka} - \mathbf{v}_{kb}||^2 = ||\hat{\mathbf{v}}_{ka} - \hat{\mathbf{v}}_{kb}||^2.
\label{equ:plane}
\end{equation}

The information acquired from user interaction will add enough constrains to solve the optimization problem, and one of the interaction is to choose the right given suggestion including points needed to be merged together. As for the point information, the constrains can be written like:

\noindent
\textbf{Merging vertexes} For any two vertexes $\mathbf{v}_p$ and $\mathbf{v}_q$ that are selected to be merged as the same vertex, we have 
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{v}_p - \mathbf{v}_q = 0.
\label{equ:point}
\end{equation}
%if these two points $\mathbf{v}_p$, $\mathbf{v}_q$ need to be moved into the same place. 


When the above constrains still lead to an ill-posed problem, soft constraints will be added to keep the original positions of irrelevant vertexes. 


\paragraph{Irrelevant vertexes} $\{\mathbf{v}_i\}$ which are not in the same plane with $\mathbf{v}_p$ or $\mathbf{v}_q$, should be stay at their original location. 
We add these soft constraints by adding a small weight $w$, which is set 0.001 in our experiments. 
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{v}_i - \mathbf{\hat{v}}_i = 0.
\label{equ:irrelevant}
\end{equation}

Figure~\ref{fig:constrain} illustrates the necessity of basic three constrains.

{\color{blue}{When we merge three vertexes circled in red Figure~\ref{fig:constrain} (b) into one location, the optimized model is generated under basic constraints shown in Figure~\ref{fig:constrain}}. The model shown in Figure~\ref{fig:constrain} (d) (e) and (f) are the results after optimizing without edge length constrain, coplanarity and face rigidity constrain separately.
